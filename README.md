## Code Samples

| demo      |  description   |
|:----------|:---------------|
| demo-v0.1 | simple timer, see talk |
| demo-v0.2 | adding sleep, see talk |
| demo-v0.3 | using system workqueue, see talk |
| demo-v0.4 | submit work item twice in a row (only the first is processed) |
| demo-v0.5 | example how to pass data to work handler using atomic type |
| demo-v0.6 | like demo-v0.5, but with delayable work. Similar pattern for cancellation |

## Trivia
**Yesternight** This is an archaic word derived from old English, which means "last night". We had a gathering on Sunday prior
to the event, where we happen to discuss the work *yesteryear* and wondered about the yester suffix and its use.
We joked about placing one one of this "yester"-word in our talks...
